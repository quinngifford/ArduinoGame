The game sets the LEDS to a random RGB color, and your goal is to guess the color within the level timer.
Timer starts at 20 seconds for level 0, with each consecutive level the timer goes down by two, so level 1 would be 18 seconds and so on.
8 levels
At the end of each round, it calculates your accuracy (Actual RGB value - the RGB value you guessed), and then it adds your accuracy to your score, lower score is better.
You use the buttons to guess each color, left button subtracts from your guess, right button adds to your guess, pressing both buttons changes the color that you are guessing (red, green, and blue)
If the switch is on, your guesses will go up or down by 10, if the switch is off, your guesses go up or down by 1
The game will make a beeping sound faster and faster as the timer gets closer to 0
